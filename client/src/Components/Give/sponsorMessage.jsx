      Thank you so much for your gift! <br /> <br /> Our written expression of thanks cannot compare
      to that which we feel in our hearts. Shalom Ministry is more than an organization; it is an
      organism made up of members of the Body of Christ. <br /> <br /> As sponsors, partners,
      participants, and givers, you too are a member of The Body. As one, we operate as the
      manifestation of Christâ€™s hands and feet on the earth, doing to Him what is done to the least
      of these (Matt. 25:40). <br /> <br /> So again, we offer our deepest heartfelt thanks for your
      gift - for you are giving to the Kingdom of God. Shalom! <br /> <br /> 1 Cor. 12:12-18
