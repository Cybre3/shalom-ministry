    <p> Shalom Ministry meets the needs of the lost, broken, and wounded as Yeshuaâ€™s <br /> extension of holistic help to those in need. We are a non-profit organization <br /> whose ambassadors compassionately listen to the individuals we serve to <br /> understand their unique needs, leading to their transformation. Our ministry <br /> began in 2018, when our founder was sent by Yeshua to Eritrea and <br /> Ghana, where she preached the Gospel, helped build schools, and <br /> provided facilities to the underprivileged population of the region. <br /> These projects serve as Shalom Ministry's heritage, which are still <br /> supported! Today and tomorrow, we seek to be the answer, the <br /> missing link, and the hands and feet of Yeshua on Earth!</p>
